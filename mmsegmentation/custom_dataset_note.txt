How to configure custom dataset:

1.1 mmseg/datasets
	* Create your custom dataset (fu_tissue.py)
		- We basically register our class here

1.2 mmseg/datasets
	* Include your class in __init__
 
2.1 configs/__base__/datasets 
	* Create your config file for your class (fu_tissue_config.py)
		- We basically configure our dataset class here
		- For instance, train pipleine, test pipeline, train loader etc.

2.2 configs/(your desired model) (for instance configs/unet)
	* Modify the model file 
		- For instance, I modified unet-s5-d16_deeplabv3_4xb4-40k_drive-64x64.py to unet-s5-d16_deeplabv3_4xb4-40k_fu-tissue-64x64_mkd.py
	* In the code, change the custom dataset config file directory in __base__. 
		- For instance, intially it was '../_base_/datasets/drive.py'. I changed it to '../_base_/datasets/fu_tissue_config.py'.
	* This file is actually called by train.py
